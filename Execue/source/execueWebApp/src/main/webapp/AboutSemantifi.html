                  <div class="content-textInner">Over 90% of the  web remains undiscovered. This is the so-called Deep Web. University of  California, Berkeley estimates the Deep Web to be over 500 times bigger than  the current surface web. Deep Web goes beyond the billions of web pages and  stored inside databases it is largely invisible to current search engines. <br />
<br />
If only the  search engines knew how to search structured data, answers will be readily  available to questions like “Dept of Defense spending between 2000 and 2008” or  &quot;Best fare from New York to London next Thursday?&quot; <br />
<br />
Users like to ask simple questions or keywords to  search multiple databases, get relevant answers, see automatic data  visualizations in real-time even from multi-terabyte databases. This is the  idea behind SEMANTIFI and the opportunity is ‘orders of magnitude larger than  current search’. </div>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Semantic  search engine driven by knowledge base for relevant answers</li>
                          <li>Automatic  data summaries &amp; visualizations to interpret database results</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p> Semantifi’s approach is to search the structured  web by <BR>
                        <ul>
<li> web hosting its search platform for anyone to use for free and </li>
<li> building an App Store like marketplace for a community of publishers to build  data search apps for all users to search.</li>
			</ul>
                          The concept of a  “Marketplace for Apps” is clearly proven with App Store, AppExchange, Facebook  Apps and so on. </p>

                    <td><div class="content-textInner">At SEMANTIFI.COM,  Semantifi's search platform will be centrally hosted for anyone to use for free.  Publishers can build their own apps to search any datasets or entire vertical  search portals. Publishers can be individual users, businesses, and content  owners. Apps can be of personal interest, or of high public appeal, or have  revenue potential. Apps can be shared publicly, or within social networks, or  only to paid subscribers. When users search, they get search results from  matching Apps. Like at App Store, commercial Apps will generate revenues. <br />
                        <br />
To illustrate,  consider an app to research equities. A publisher sources finance data feeds,  configures to the search platform and publishes it. Thompson Reuters or Zacks  can be such a publisher. A travel portal like Expedia can configure its  reservations databases so travelers can see best itineraries, a retailer like  J&amp;R could configure its product catalog so shoppers can see products that  match its catalog and so on. <br />
<br />
A few more ideas  of Apps can be an eBay Sellers App to research bid data, a US schools App to  research schools performance, a FDIC App to investigate soundness of Banks, an  App to search Craigslist Auto/Jobs/Real Estate, etc. </div></td>
